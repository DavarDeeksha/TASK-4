# TASK-4
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL. It showcases how to summarize, categorize, and filter data using aggregate functions, grouping, and conditions on grouped data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from a structured sales dataset.

 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about product sales, including:

Order ID

Product Line (category)

Number of Units Sold

Unit Price

Total Sale Amount

Each row represents an individual sale transaction.

 Concepts Covered
 Aggregate Functions
Used to perform operations like finding the total, average, or count of numeric values in columns.

 Grouping with GROUP BY
Allows the categorization of data into groups (e.g., by product line) for meaningful comparison and summary.

 Filtering Groups with HAVING
Used to apply conditions on groups after aggregation (e.g., filtering product lines with high total sales).
